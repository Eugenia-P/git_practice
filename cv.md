3. The main purpose of life is to keep developing yourself. That's why it is so important for me to be *educated* and *up-to-date*. 
I believe that IT area is the best place for **development** and **achievement of the** most **goals** I've set myself. IT is great for development and *self-
education* because you have to constantly learn, learn and learn in order to keep your job. And learning is not a big deal for me as I can *sponge knowledge* fast 
(or at least find the answers in Google fast :)) That's why I am so into IT area and, especially, **programming**. Despite the fact I have a *degree in linguistics*, 
I have always been *interested in technologies* which can be proven by my ability of solving first all the given tasks at computer classes during my 
studies at the high school and the university, and helping my mates after finishing them. That hepled me to realize that I like computers and 
everything related to it.
As much as I love the process of creating something new, coding and overall "communicating" with PC, I also love money (as everyone else do). Isn't it the
most popular reason why people decide to switch their career and enter in IT? I am that kind of person who cares a lot about **carreer** and opportunity 
to be **paid well and fairly** for the current knowledge and experience in the chosen area. Considering my vast *work experience in the USA* during 
my university summer holidays, I know how *motivated*, *productive* and *efficient* I become knowing that I receive a great payment hourly or per month.  
In conlusion, I would like to add some points from my to-do list which I've made last year for the nearest 2-3 years (the list is much longer):

- [x] Start learning JavaScript
- [x] Get a temporary part-time job
- [ ] Get a well-paid job ($1000 salary)
- [ ] Get hired by EPAM 
It might shock you what amount of monthly salary I had set myself to gain in the nearest future but there's a cool phrase I always say: 
> The higher goals you set 
> The more you achieve. -  Eugenia Protasevich

Hopefully, the Rolling Scopes School's course will help me to achieve the latter goal (and maybe the third one as well, with time and huge efforts) 
and become software engineer at EPAM.


4. 
Skills (e.g. 
JavaScript programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
